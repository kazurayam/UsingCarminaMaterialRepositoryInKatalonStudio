Step by step instruction - how to create a visual testing project from scratch
============

(Note at Nov 2019)
The document titled "Step by step instruction" was removed at the version 1.10.1 released at 12 May
because the version 1.10 introduced a completely new approach of creating a visual testing project
from scracth. As of the version 1.10, you are supposed to use a Gradle plugin [visualtestinginks](https://github.com/kazurayam/visualtestinginks-gradle-plugin)
to import the necessary resources which enables your own Katalon Studio project for Visual Testing.

Please read the documentations of visualtestinginks:
